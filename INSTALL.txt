Installation on *NIX
--------------------

NOTE!! THIS IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL. The game does not have to be
       installed to play. The currently directory layout was not
       designed with Unix-style installation in mind. For a
       QUICK START see in doc/Introduction.html.

The game (and the man pages) can be installed on *NIX systems into a
standard location like this:

1) Check locations and permissions in the top-level Makefile. The game
   is installed into /usr/local by default.

2) Optionally run "make" to build extensions that enable cool powerups
   and xshm operation. Recommended

3) Run "make install" as root or other user with sufficient rights.

NOTE!! The game logic is still quite directory-layout dependant ATM so
       installing is implemented by copying the whole directory into
       /usr/local/lib/ (the location can be changed in the Makefile)
       and making symlinks to appropriate directories. This procedure
       will probably be cleaned up in future releases.
