In the current version most graphics have been made by David
Gowers, based on graphics from McSebi.

Almost all sounds, background musics and levels are directly
taken from the MacOS version of Bub & Bob 1 by McSebi.  Thanks
to him for great artwork and his permission to redistribute
it!  He released them under the following terms:
