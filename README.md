# New BSD Games

The TUI games i made for NetBSD ( If they accept these ).

These include:

Jewels (A game with a gameplay similiar to that of Tetris, NOT my invention)  
Sudoku  
Mines (Minesweeper)  
Reversi  
Checkers  
Battleship  

### Prerequisites

ALL you need is a C compiler with C99 enabled , the standard library and libncurses (the dev package if you are on debian).

### How to run

Just download them somehow and compile them with ncurses being linked.

Normally:

```
cc "address_to_sourcefiles/game_name.c" -lncurses -o "address_to_binaries/game_name"
```

I am too lazy to write a script for this.

### How do these look like
