Try to find the landmines in the field
.P
with logical reasoning: When you click
.P
on a tile ( a \'\.\' here), numbers may show
.P
up that indicate the number of landmines
.P
in adjacent tiles; you should find and
.P
avoid the landmines based on them; and
.P
clicking on a landmine would make you
.P
lose the game\.
